- Section
The name of the room must come before any section.
Each section starts with "\n- "
There can be as many sections as you want.
Multiple sections with the same Name will be treated as the same one with contents in the order the sections appear.
If the engine does not recognise a section name it will ignore that section.
The following sections must exist at this point:
Background: Map of prefab tiles. Must be rectangular.
Objects: Layer above the background.
Doors: Valid entry points into the puzzle. Used to generate surroundings.
